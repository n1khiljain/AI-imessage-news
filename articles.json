        "text": "This week, AI chipmaker Cerebras Systems announced that it raised $1 billion in fresh capital at a valuation of$23 billion\u2014 a nearly threefold increase from the$8.1 billionvaluation the Nvidia rival had reached just six months earlier.\n\nWhile the round was led by Tiger Global, a huge part of the new capital came from one of the company\u2019s earliest backers: Benchmark Capital. The prominent Silicon Valley firm invested at least $225 million in Cerebras\u2019 latest round, according to a person familiar with the deal.\n\nBenchmark first bet on 10-year-old Cerebras when it led the startup\u2019s $27 million Series A in 2016.Since Benchmark deliberately keeps its funds\u00a0under $450 million,\u00a0the firm raised\u00a0two\u00a0separate\u00a0vehicles, both called \u2018Benchmark Infrastructure,\u2019 according to regulatory filings. According to the person familiar with the deal, these vehicles were created specifically to fund the Cerebras investment.\n\nBenchmark declined to comment.\n\nWhat sets Cerebras apart is the sheer physical scale of its processors. The company\u2019s Wafer Scale Engine, its flagship chip announced in 2024, measures approximately 8.5 inches on each side and packs 4 trillion transistors into a single piece of silicon. To put that in perspective, the chip is manufactured from nearly an entire 300-millimeter silicon wafer, the circular discs that serve as the foundation for all semiconductor production. Traditional chips are thumbnail-sized fragments cut from these wafers; Cerebras instead uses almost the whole circle.\n\nThis architecture delivers 900,000 specialized cores working in parallel, allowing the system to process AI calculations without shuffling data between multiple separate chips (a major bottleneck in conventional GPU clusters). The company says the design enables AI inference tasks to run more than 20 times faster than competing systems.\n\nThe funding comes as Cerebras, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., gains momentum in the AI infrastructure race. Last month, Cerebras signed a multi-year agreement worth morethan $10 billionto provide 750 megawatts of computing power to OpenAI. The partnership, which extends through 2028, aims to help OpenAI deliver faster response times for complex AI queries. (OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is also an investor in Cerebras.)\n\nCerebras claims its systems, built with its proprietary chips designed for AI use, are faster than Nvidia\u2019s chips.\n\nThe company\u2019s path to going public has been complicated by its relationship with G42, a UAE-based AI firm that accounted for 87% of Cerebras\u2019 revenue as of the first half of 2024. G42\u2019s historical ties to Chinese technology companies triggered a national security review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, bumping back Cerebras\u2019 initial IPO plans and even prompting the outfit to withdraw an earlier filing in early 2025. By late last year, G42 had been removed from Cerebras\u2019 investor list, clearing the way for a fresh IPO attempt.\n\nCerebras is now preparing for a public debut in the second quarter of 2026,according to Reuters.\n\n"

        "text": "The war on California\u2019sproposed \u2018Billionaire\u2019s Tax\u2019is getting weird. This week, amidongoing rancorfrom tech elites over the much maligned bill, it became apparent that someone was planning a so-called \u201cMarch for Billionaires\u201d in San Francisco. Awebsiteadvertising the event popped up online, providing little in the way of context other than a pithy tagline: \u201cVilifying billionaires is popular. Losing them is expensive.\u201d\n\nThe immediate reaction was incredulity, and most people assumed the site was some sort of bizarre hoax. \u201cthis is a joke/satire right??\u201d one social media userwrotenot long after the news circulated. Now, however, the apparent organizer behind the event has revealed that the march is definitelynota joke, and that it is scheduled to take place this coming Saturday.\n\nThe San Francisco Examinerfirst reportedthat the event\u2019s organizer had been revealed as Derik Kauffman, the founder of AI startup RunRL, which previously participated in Y Combinator\u2019s accelerator program. Kauffman told the Examiner that the event was not being funded or organized by any outside group, no big monied associations or companies\u2014just him.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCrunch, Kauffman \u2014 who also told the Examiner that he was no longer involved with RunRL \u2014 confirmed that the impetus for the upcoming rally was California\u2019s proposed wealth tax, which the tech founder said he believed would be \u201cquite damaging to the tech economy.\u201d\n\nThe policy in question, theBillionaire Tax Act, was introduced last year, and would require Californians worth over $1 billion to pay a one-time 5% tax on their total wealth. The legislation, which isbacked by the state\u2019s healthcare union SEIU(Service Employees International Union), could pay for important public services and help the state offset recent federal funding cuts, accordingto some experts. Nevertheless, the policy has led to loud protestations from some of the tech industry\u2019s most prominent figures, many of whom have either threatened to leave California orhave already left. It has also led to amonsoon of lobbyingin the California legislature, in an effort to defeat the bill.\n\nWhen asked why he opposed the legislation, Kauffman expressed concern for how the bill could impact the startup economy in Silicon Valley. \u201cThis tax in particular is fatally flawed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt hits startup founders whose wealth is only on paper. They would be forced to liquidate shares on potentially unfavorable terms, incurring capital gains taxes and giving up control. Not to mention the difficulty of valuing private companies.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany founders would be hit with wildly disproportionate tax bills,\u201d Kauffman continued. \u201cAdditionally, there\u2019s no precedent for this sort of comprehensive wealth tax in the US. Sweden eliminated theirs 20 years ago to avert capital flight and promote entrepreneurship and now has 50% more billionaires per capital than the US.\u201d\n\nOnline conversation about Kauffman\u2019s planned event has continued to alternate between incredulity and ridicule. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine billionaires marching in the street,\u201d onesocial media user said, of the event.\n\nThat person would probably be right.\n\nKauffman told TC that, so far, he isn\u2019t aware of any actual billionaires planning to attend the march that has been organized in their honor. Kauffman said that the event is likely to include \u201ca few dozen attendees,\u201d although he stressed that he really isn\u2019t clear on how many people would show up.\n\nThe ongoing outrage over the proposed tax is a little funny, given that it\u2019s already been known for quite some time that the legislation has almost no chance of being enacted. That\u2019s because California Governor Gavin Newsom has already stated that, should the bill somehow pass, he wouldveto it."

        "text": "HBO\u2019s hit financial thriller \u201cIndustry\u201d has delivered one of its most compelling storylines yet this season: a hunt to expose a fraudulent fintech company called Tender.\n\nThe show follows Harper Stern, who\u2019s leading her newly launched investment firm and looking for a company to short \u2014 essentially, betting that its stock will crash. After a journalist tips her off that something\u2019s wrong with Tender, she sends her associates, Sweetpea and Kwabena, to Ghana to investigate.\n\nWhat they discover is damning. \u201cFake users drive fake revenue drives fake cash,\u201d Sweetpea tells Harper. The entire company appears to be built on fabricated numbers. \u201cThe thing is nothing.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s fascinating about this season of \u201cIndustry\u201d is how well it speaks to this moment. Tender starts as a payment processing platform for adult content. The show references the very real (and still controversial)Online Safety Billthat the UK introduced, which has led to age verification and other enhanced rules for consuming adult content online. Because of its affiliation with adult content, Tender finds itself at odds with the new government\u2019s regulation and must pivot or die, as the saying goes.\n\nIts CFO-turned-leader, Whitney, wants the company to pivot into a bank and has a plan to make that happen, including making Tender\u2019s CEO, Henry, the face of that transformation. Whitney is the embodiment of every tech baron cliche. Move fast, break things. Win at all costs.\u00a0He\u2019s lobbying politicians for a banking license and hunting for merger opportunities.\n\nHarper, meanwhile, is leading her newly launched firm after feeling undermined at her previous firm and being called a DEI plant by the man who hired her (a nod to the decline of DEI in the past few years). She has teamed up with new friends and old frenemies and is looking for blood \u2014 meaning a company on the precipice of crashing. To her, Tender is that company.\n\nThis puts her at odds with her friend Yasmin, who is married to Henry and is crafting communication and lobbying strategies for Tender. It\u2019s pride and prejudice \u2014 the sugar and spice that help make the world go round.\n\nThe show nails the tech world with such accuracy that reality itself starts to feel like satire. Even TechCrunch gets name-checked as part of Tender\u2019s media playbook.\n\nThere is commentary on fascism via the character Moritz, who lobbies against Western liberalism and is hesitant to sell his family\u2019s bank to Whitney, whose last name is theJewish-sounding Halberstram. The character is perhaps a nodto the rising \u201ctechnofacism\u201d criticismof some tech barons.\n\nHarper, meanwhile, is still a calculating sociopath. \u201cMy real passion lies with finding dead men walking,\u201d she says at an investor breakfast. She ends up raising millions for her new firm.\n\nShe is the one character whose existence strains credibility. Personality-wise, she has to be shrewdly calculating; unlike Yasmin and Henry, she has nothing to fall back on should she fail. But would the UK establishment, which is notoriously insular, exclusionary, and white, really let a Black American woman rise through their ranks and beat them at their own game?\n\n\u201cWho needs realism when she\u2019s such a great character,\u201d one Black British founder told me.\n\nHe said the show aptly captures how detached the UK upper class is from consequence and is actually one of the few shows he\u2019s seen that \u201caccurately portrays the ruthlessness of the British elite, specifically how they maneuver the media and governments to suit their own whims.\u201d\n\n\u201cNepotism and lack of boundaries at work, people sleeping together for trade secrets, is very realistic and common, unfortunately,\u201d one European investor added.\n\nMeanwhile, Yasmin is headed down a dark path. Earlier this season, she organized a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois between her husband, Henry, and Whitney\u2019s assistant, Hayley. As the season continues, her behavior becomes so hedonistic that one reviewer has already likened her toGhislaine Maxwell\u2014 perhaps a perfect emblem of what lies at the pits of money and power, and the role some women play in digging those holes.\n\nAn Icarus moment could be on the way, however, at least for Whitney.\n\nBy now, the audience is familiar with how founders in the real world sometimes use deception to overinflate success (likeCharlie Javice\u2019s Frank) and allegedly steal from investors and the public (the FTX crypto crash). There are many such infamous cases, and some are even referenced in the show. But perhaps the most relevant real-world parallel for Tender would be the ultimateimplosionof the German fintech Wirecard a few years ago.\n\nWirecardadmitted that the billions in cashit reported having likely never existed, despite the company\u2019s earlier claims that two banks in the Philippines were holding the funds. It was a tale of complex accounting and legal gray zones \u2014 much like the financial fraud depicted in Tender. Short sellerswent after Wirecard, too, and one blog dubbed them \u201calternative whistleblowers\u201d \u2014 people who step in when \u201cthe market, and the regulator, refuse to see what is right in front of them.\u201d\n\nThe philosophy is one that one could easily see Harper embracing soon enough, especially after Eric tells her at one point that \u201cshort-only work is ugly, hard, investigative,\u201d and that it\u2019s \u201canti-status quo, anti-establishment, anti-power.\u201d\n\nWith Wirecard,numerous people,includingthe CEO, were arrested, while the COOwent on the run(andwas also accused of being a Russian spy). Tender\u2019s fate remains unrealized until the last few episodes run. One of the best parts about \u201cIndustry\u201d is that it moves fast and breaks things. It is so clearly set in our time and so audacious in its demeanor that the audience is forced to pick their favorite anti-hero and go along for the ride.\n\nIt\u2019s a rush, a thrill; the visual embodiment of the absence of ethical capitalists. And yet, just like in real life, we can\u2019t get enough."

        "text": "Followinglast year\u2019s trend of showcasing AIin multimillion-dollar ad spots, the 2026 Super Bowl advertisements took it a step further by leveraging AI both to create the commercials and to promote the latest AI products. Love it or hate it, the technology has become a star in its own right, alongside the latest movie trailers and snack brands.\n\nLet\u2019s explore the biggest moments from this year\u2019s Big Game ads, which featured everything from robots and AI glasses to a touch of drama involving tech founders.\n\nVodka brand Svedka went with what it touts as the first \u201cprimarily\u201d AI-generated national Super Bowl spot. The 30-second ad, titled \u201cShake Your Bots Off,\u201d features the company\u2019s robot character, Fembot, and her new companion, Brobot, dancing their circuits off at a human party.\n\nAccording to Svedka\u2019s parent company, Sazerac, it took roughly four months to reconstruct the Fembot and train the AI to mimic facial expressions and body movements,The Wall Street Journal reported. However, the vodka brand noted that certain aspects were still handled by humans, such as developing the storyline.\n\n\n\n\u200bThe company partnered with AI company Silverside to create the Super Bowl spot,according to ADWEEK. Silverside AI is the same team behind recent AI-generatedCoca-Cola commercialsthatsparked controversy.\n\n\u200bIt\u2019s a bold move to debut AI-generated content during the Super Bowl, an event known for star-studded, high-production ads. The heavy reliance on AI is polarizing, fueling debates over whether AI will replace creative jobs.\n\nEither way, Svedka definitely got people talking.\n\nAnthropic\u2019s adwasn\u2019t just about selling its Claude chatbot; it was about throwing shade. The commercial took a jab atOpenAI\u2019s plan to introduce ads to ChatGPT, with a tagline: \u201cAds are coming to AI. But not to Claude.\u201d Rather than focus solely on Claude\u2019s features, itpoked funat the idea of your helpful AI assistant suddenly turning into a hype man for \u201cStep Boost Maxx\u201d insoles, for example.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a standard product pitch, and it escalated into anonline feud. OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altmanfired backon social media, calling the ad \u201cclearly dishonest.\u201d So while we didn\u2019t get any more Kendrick vs. Drake rap beef this time around, maybe we did get our ownAI, nerdy version of it.\n\n\n\nMeta spotlighted itsOakley-branded AI glasses, designed for sports, workouts, and adventures, including extreme scenarios such as chasing down a departing plane.\n\nThe ad showcased thrill-seekers, from skydivers to mountain bikers, using the glasses to capture epic moments. Famous faces like IShowSpeed and filmmaker Spike Lee made appearances, demonstrating capabilities like filming a basketball dunk in slow motion, posting hands-free to Instagram, and other advanced features.\n\nThe tech giant also featured its wearable AI tech in last year\u2019s Super Bowl ad to spark consumer interest, with stars like Chris Pratt, Chris Hemsworth, and Kris Jenner showing off Ray-Ban Meta glasses.\n\n\n\nAmazon\u2019s ad took a cheeky (and slightly unsettling) approach, starring Chris Hemsworth in a satirical \u201cAI is out to get me\u201d storyline. The commercial exaggerates common fears about AI, with Hemsworth humorously accusing Alexa+ of plotting against him. Scenes included Alexa+ closing the garage door on his head and shutting the pool cover while he swam, each mishap escalating in absurdity.\n\nBeyond the dark comedy, the ad introduced the new Alexa+, showcasing its enhanced intelligence and capabilities, ranging from managing smart home devices to planning vacations. Alexa+ had been available in early access for over a year andofficially launchedto all U.S. users on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nRing\u2019s commercial spotlighted its\u201cSearch Party\u201d feature, which leverages AI and a community network to reunite lost pets with their owners. The ad followed a young girl searching for her dog Milo, illustrating how users can upload a pet\u2019s photo to the app, where AI works to identify matches and taps into nearby cameras and the broader Ring user community to help track down missing furry family members.\n\nRingrecently announcedthat anyone can now use Search Party, even without owning a Ring security camera. According to the company, the feature has already helped reunite more than one lost dog with its owner every day.\n\n\n\nGoogle\u2019s ad showcased theNano Banana Pro, its newest image-generation model. The commercial followed a mother and son as they used AI to envision and design their new home, uploading photos of bare rooms and turning them into personalized spaces with just a few prompts.\n\n\n\nRamp scored big by getting Brian Baumgartner \u2014 the actor who played Kevin in \u201cThe Office\u201d \u2014 for its Super Bowl commercial.\n\nIn the spot, Baumgartner uses Ramp\u2019s AI-powered spend management platform to \u201cmultiply\u201d himself, effortlessly tackling a mountain of work. The ad highlights how Ramp\u2019s all-in-one solution helps teams focus on the most important tasks through smart automation.\n\nAnd, as a playful nod to his TV persona, Baumgartner is seen carrying a pot of chili in the ad, referencing Kevin\u2019s legendary scene where he brings his cherished recipe for his co-workers to try, only to disastrously spill the entire pot on the floor.\n\n\n\nRippling, the cloud-based workforce management platform, went all in on itsfirst-ever Super Bowl ad. The company tapped comedian Tim Robinson in a spot about onboarding an alien monster, poking fun at HR headaches and the promise of AI automation.\n\n\n\nHealth company Hims & Hers used its Super Bowl spot to address disparities in healthcare access. The ad cleverly references the lengths the wealthy go to for health and longevity, even appearing to poke fun at Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin spaceflight in 2021 and Bryan Johnson\u2019sexpensive anti-aging routines.\n\nIn recent years, the company launched an AI-powered \u201cMedMatch\u201d tool to deliver more personalized treatment recommendations, especially for mental health and wellness.\n\n\n\nWebsite builder Wix spotlighted its new AI-powered Wix Harmony platform, promising website creation as easy as chatting with a friend.

        "summary": "The mysterious businessman pitched Jeffrey Epstein on numerous mobility startups in an era when the sector was white hot, according to TechCrunch's review of hundreds of documents released by the Department of Justice.",
        "text": "Electric vehicle startup Lucid Motors was scrambling to raise a Series D funding round in 2017. It had courted Ford as a potential investor, but Jia Yueting, the founder of rival EV startup Faraday Future, had quietly amassed around a 30% stake and was essentially blocking new investors.\n\nDavid Stern, a mysterious businessman and close advisor to former Prince Andrew, saw an opportunity to break the logjam: bring in Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n\u201cFord will likely be lead in $400m Series D in Lucid. Big strategic move,\u201d Sternwroteto Epstein in emails released last week as part of the Department of Justice\u2019s latest disclosure of 3 million documents related to Epstein. Jia \u201chas massive cash issues\u201d at Faraday, he wrote, and needs to \u201csell now to make payroll for his other business.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the first EV startup Stern pitched Epstein, and it wouldn\u2019t be the last, according to hundreds of documents reviewed by TechCrunch.\n\nAt the time, legacy automakers and newly minted startups, fueled by the breakthrough success of Tesla and progress by Google\u2019s self-driving project, were jumping into electric and autonomous vehicles. And Stern was apparently hungry to take advantage of the resulting deal flow. The documents show he also pitched investments in Faraday Future and in another EV startup, Canoo.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely Epstein invested in any of them. Lucid didn\u2019t close its Series D until late 2018, when it raised more than $1 billion from Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. Faraday ultimately received a major investment from Chinese real estate conglomerate Evergrande in late 2017. Epstein said in a 2018 message included in the Justice Department\u2019s files that he had no \u201cdirect\u201d or \u201cindirect\u201d interest in Canoo.\n\nThese discussions instead provide greater insight into themany connectionsEpstein, a convicted sex offender, had to Silicon Valley startups up until his arrest and death in 2019. They also provide a snapshot of a relationship that has not been explored in previous reporting.\n\nBy the time of the Lucid emails, Epstein and Stern had been working together closely for nearly a decade, the newly released documents show.\u00a0 To Epstein, Sternwas\u201cmy china contact.\u201d To Stern, Epsteinwas\u201cmy mentor, and I do what he tells me.\u201d\n\nStern is a mostly digital ghost with little information available about him on the internet prior to the release of the files.\n\nHe is perhaps best known as the director of Prince Andrew\u2019s Pitch@Palace startup contest, which ran for a few years until Andrew\u2019s connections to Epstein were exposed. Andrew even referred to Stern as a \u201cghost\u201d inone 2010 email.\n\nStern appears to have first approached Epstein in 2008, according to the emails released by the DOJ \u2014 just one month before the financier pled guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution in Florida. Stern was creating a fund, called AGC Capital, to take advantage of the economic boom in China, and he wanted Epstein to invest.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how Stern was introduced to Epstein. Stern did not respond to a detailed list of questions for this article.\n\nStern, who is German, attended the University of London and Shi-Da University in China in the late 1990s, and served as chairman of China Millennium Capital, the Chinese arm of Millennium Capital Partners, according to the bio section of the AGC Capitalpitch deck, which is in the DOJ\u2019s files.\n\nStern also worked for Siemens, negotiating \u201cindustrial Joint Ventures with Chinese State Owned enterprises,\u201d before joining the Shanghai office of Deutsche Bank. He started a company called Asia Gateway in 2001 that \u201cadvised blue chip companies, Chinese enterprises as well as the Chinese government in growth strategies and investments.\u201d\n\nThese jobs appear to have helped Stern make connections with powerful and wealthy Chinese businessmen, including Li Botan \u2014 the son-in-law of the fourth-most senior leader in China under Xi Jinping\u2019s predecessor Hu Jintao. (Li would eventually go on to become a founding investor in Canoo with Stern.)\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if Epstein invested in AGC Capital; the financier spent the next year serving his sentence. But Stern and Epstein remained in touch, and in 2009 Stern started pitching other ideas.\n\nThe documents reveal a relationship that starts off formal and terse, with Epstein at one pointexcoriatingStern for not having properly prepared a potential business deal.\n\n\u201c[I]f you want to do real deals you have to be precise and careful\u201e every error is a fortune,\u201d Epstein wrote. \u201c[Y]our first grade is an F.\u201d\n\nOne of the first big projects the two men collaborated on was helping the Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, withher miserable finances,according to the emails.\n\nThe relationship deepened over the following decade. The two men got close enough that Stern felt comfortableaskingEpstein in 2016 to become the godfather of one of his children. (Epstein wrote that he was \u201cflattered\u201d but declined because he \u201cmade a promise to my goddaughter that I would not be godfather to anyone else.\u201d)\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say how fruitful the relationship was on the business side. But between 2009 and 2019, Stern brought Epstein a number of potential deals across various industries.\n\nEarly on, he seemed dead set on starting a \u201csecret\u201d newfundwith Epstein to invest in Chinese businesses together, which he referred to as JEDS \u2014 the two men\u2019s initials combined. (It was also referred to in some emails as \u201cSerpentine Group.\u201d) Stern laterpitchedbuying farmland in Russia,suggestedpurchasing the news organization Al Jazeera and taking it public,discussedbuying troubled music publisher EMI, and considered acquiring an apparently distressed (and unnamed)undersea cable company.\n\nThey also had their eyes on banks. Stern and Epstein attempted to buy Luxembourg-headquartered private bank Sal. Oppenheim,the emails show. In 2016, they even discussed abuyout of Deutsche Bank,which had for yearstransactedwith Epstein.\n\nStern repeatedly flaunted his connections with high-profile businessmen and politicians in his emails to Epstein and his other contacts. In February 2012, SternsuggestedEpstein introduce Jes Staley \u2014 the head of J.P. Morgan\u2019s investment bank at the time \u2014 to Malaysian politician Anwar Ibrahim.\n\n\u201cI know Anwar well,\u201d Stern wrote. \u201cIf he becomes prime minister of malayisa [Staley] will clean up and it could be a gold mine for JPM.\u201d (Ibrahim lost a contested election in 2013 but became prime minister in 2022.)\n\nStern also claimed to have haddinner with Jack Ma, had a planned meeting \u201calone\u201d with UAE president Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and said he was \u201cfriends\u201d with the grandson of former Chinese president Jiang Zemin.\n\nBy 2017, Stern was apparently eyeing the rush to build new mobility companies.\n\nHe tried to get Epstein to meet Faraday Future founder Jia to discuss an investment. It\u2019s not clear if that ever happened; the company and Jia did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBut former BMW and Deutsche Bank CFO Stefan Krause, who had been brought in to save Faraday Future, made a direct appeal to Epstein in April 2017.\n\n\u201cFaraday Future (FF) is a great story in itself, regretfully surrounded by a lot of noise around Jia Yueting (YT) and his other enterprises (LeEco, LeMall, LeSports, to name a few). These businesses are not working, so he run out of cash. FF is starving,\u201d Krausewroteto Epstein. \u201cGreat chance to build a better Tesla.\u201d\n\n(Krause is described as a \u201cfriend\u201d and a business partner of Stern\u2019s in the documents. He didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.)\n\nIt appears those conversations petered out. Soon after, Stern suggested the Lucid Motors investment.\n\nIn May 2017, a pitch deck landed in Epstein\u2019s inbox. It wasput together by a fund called Monsterathat Stern hadcreated. \u201cMonstera can gain a 32% shareholding in Lucid through the acquisition of the stake currently controlled by Yueting Jia,\u201d one slide reads. Other emails show that Stern expected to spend around $300 million toacquire the 32% stake.\n\nHereferredto it as a \u201cfire sale\u201d in emails. Monstera could either hold the position or \u201c[o]ffload\u201d it \u201cwhen Ford comes in.\u201d\n\nFord ultimatelypulled out,and Lucid had to wait to close its Series D until August 2018, when Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund invested more than $1 billion. (SEC filings show the Saudi sovereign wealth fund repurchased Jia\u2019s shares over the next few years. Lucid did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nWhen Krause left Faraday Future to start a new EV company in late 2017 \u2014 first called Evelozcity and later, Canoo \u2014 Stern was one of the original backers. He contributed just $1 million alongside larger sums from Li, the CCP-connected Chinese businessman, and Michael Chiang, a billionaire who runs Taiwanese electronics giant TPK. (Li\u2019s involvement later triggered a national security review when Canoo went public in 2020.)\n\nIn June 2018, Stern sent Epstein a document about the startup, to which Epstein responded: \u201cfun.\u201d\n\nBut Epstein never invested in Canoo, either. He did, however, pitch powerful people on Stern\u2019s behalf. EpsteinemailedDeepak Chopra in May 2018 and told the self-help guru that \u201cdavid has a new electric car co in los angeles.\u201d He told Chopra \u201cthey are going to build the next gen health sensors into the car. you guys should talk.\u201d\n\nIn June 2019, Epstein sent a message to Eduardo Teodorani, an Italian businessman who is a senior vice president of agriculture machinery giant CNH. \u201cMy friend David stern\u2026 has a electric car co that I think you should explore before he sells it to another co,\u201d Epstein wrote. Epstein alsoconnectedStern with Sheikh Jabor al Thani, a member of the Qatari royal family, on June 29 so he could \u201chear more about your car co.\u201d\n\nOne week after he sent that message, Epstein was arrested. He died in prison a month later.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear when Stern last spoke to Epstein. But in March 2019, he forwarded a story to Epstein titled: \u201cWarren Buffet: Electric Cars Are Very Much in America\u2019s Future.\u201d\u00a0In the body of the email, Sternwrote: \u201cHow do we get him ??\u201d"

The sale was driven largely by big investors like sovereign wealth funds, which want to work with companies that can handle large contracts. Eion was simply too small, Eion CEO Anastasia Pavlovic HanstoldThe Wall Street Journal.\n\nBoth companies spread pulverized rocks on farm fields to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Known as enhanced rock weathering (EWR), it speeds up a natural process and has the potential to be alow-cost way to remove carbon, but it requires large and distributed operations. The spread between what EWR companies would like to charge and what buyers would like to payremains wide, according to a survey by CDR.fyi.\n\nCalifornia-based Terradot\u2019s operations are centered on Brazil, where the company works with basalt as its mineral of choice, while Eionworks in the U.S. and uses olivine.
